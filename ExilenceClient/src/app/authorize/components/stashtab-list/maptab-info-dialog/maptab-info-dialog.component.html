  <p>
    We detected that the the selected tab is a maptab. There are some special rules applying to the maptab. Please see
    below.
  </p>

  <li>The maptab needs to be set to public for it to work</li>
  <li>The maptab is not supported in SSF/private leagues, since there is no trade-listings for these leagues</li>
  <li>Do not to spam the official trade-site, in rare cases this could lead to net worth fluctuations</li>
  <li>While the maptab is selected no maps outside of the maptab will count towards your networth </li>
  <li>While the maptab is selected the time it takes to snapshot your networth may increase. Especially if you have
    many maps</li>
  <li>If you experience delays in fetching your maps, this is likely due to GGG's trade API being slow or
    not
    updated yet</li>

  <!-- <ul>
    <li>If you select the maptab, we assume all of your maps is in the maptab, and will not count maps from other tabs</li>
    <li>If you have many maps, your net worth will update more slowly with the maptab enabled</li>
    <li>Note that the maptab itself will update more seldom than the rest of your stash!</li>
    <li>The maptab is not included by GGG, and instead we have to go through the trade API, which may cause delays</li>
  </ul> -->
